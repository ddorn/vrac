# Python Vrac

This is a folder where I mostly make experiments
and where I put projects that are not important enough
to have their one git repository, but still deserve 
saving, versioning and backups.

Most code here is written in python, at a specific moment
in time and without maintainability in mind. This said,
most code should be readable and executable. 
I manage my dependencies with poetry.

Most experiments are contained in one file and the output
is graphical, or mathematical/theoretic.


Probably not up to date list of things here:
 - `sparkles.py`: a particle system inspired by [DaFluffyPtato](https://youtu.be/wNMRq_uoWM0)
 - `tommy.py`: a simple 2 player game made only with particles, where you shoot at each other, with lots of colour
